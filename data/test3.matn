matn kaatib              byorg
added scroll bar
scroll to cursor
page up/down without moving the cursor               ygy
also added three styles & two kinds of selection:
¿±£¶Æ¾, £¨£, ±¶­

this is just a test to see how well kaatib performs with scrolling, it just needs to have
a lot of matn ¿£À to deal with to make sure that it can actually handle it

i just wanted to see if these new features will be easy to implement or not
if they are easy, then we'll try to include them in the todo list

the same features were implemented before in the nodejs version of nizaam but
now we're doing things differently, inshallah this time they'll be way better

see it tear you up and it calls your bluff, when the lie that keeps you warm
is the truth you're fighting for

up in the clouds, tell me sister are you coming down
